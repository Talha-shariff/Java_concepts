// we create interface as an alternative to the abstract classes 
 
    // by default while declaring variables they are having => final, static
    // and in methods there is no need to declare them as public and abstract as they are by default
//  interface A{
//     void show();
//  }
//  class B implements A{
//     public void show(){
//         System.out.println("in class b");
//     }
//  }

// little depth going in abstract classes
